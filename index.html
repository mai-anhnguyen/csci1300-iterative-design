        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          All design is iterative. Whether working within a group, for a customer, making a web interface, or a rocket engine, success necessitates openness to change and diverse perspectives. 

          Over the course of this project, our team of four collaborated with Zest, a corporate gifting platform, to design a new interface for large-scale uploads of recipient information. From developing initial concepts within our group to showcasing our final mockup feature, we leveraged multiple opportunities for feedback and revision to create a more robust and polished feature. Here was our iterative process.

        <h2>The Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          The first step of any design process is identifying the problem(s) one hopes to solve. In our case, we communicated with Zest’s lead UI Designer to establish a solid foundation for our work. The problem was as such: Zest’s current interface for CSV uploading was too restrictive, frustrating customers and limiting businesses' ability to customize their interface. We were tasked with creating an interface that could accommodate a diverse set of inputs while streamlining the whole process for the customer.

      <section id="output">
        <h2>Step 1: Initial Concepting</h2>
        <p>Once we had a clear idea of the problem we were trying to solve, each member of our team sketched out a series of screens representing four unique implementations of the feature. None of us communicated during this process, and we didn’t look at Zest’s current interface. The purpose of this step was to generate fresh ideas.</p>
        <p>The first set of sketches represent four main steps. First, the user selects how they would like to enter the recipient info. After following the instructions to upload a CSV (should they choose that option), they are taken to a page which informs them of all required fields. If they choose to continue, a loading screen updates them on the status of their upload.</p>
        <p>Key Features:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Presents the user with alternatives to CSV upload</li>
          <li>Option to download CSV template</li>
          <li>Provides clear instructions to the user at each step of the process</li>
          <li>Clear distinction between required and optional fields</li>
          <li>Visual updates keep the user engaged during down-time</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 2: Combining Our Ideas</h2>
        <p>Once all four of us had come up with unique implementations of the feature, it was time to combine them into one unified wireframe. The purpose of this step was to take the best ideas from each of our concepts and build a prototype using them. Using four independently-created concepts allowed us to identify which features we had converged on, while also prompting us to investigate areas where our implementations differed. The result was a prototype where each feature had been weighed against alternatives—a much more robust first draft than any one of us could have created alone.</p>
